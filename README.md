###Application domain  
My application aims to provide a solution to students looking for a university with specific criteria. Students often find themselves confused because of the amount of information that come up when they try to look for a university. This application makes that task easier because you choose the criteria which will filter the results. The criteria available are the universityâ€™s continent, its ranking but als o the tuition fees
